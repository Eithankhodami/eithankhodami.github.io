          <p class="paragraph">I am a Marie Sk≈Çodowska-Curie Fellow, currently working at the Department of General Psychology, University of Padua. My research focuses on several areas, including attention, visual processing speed, COVID-19 and mental health, visual perception, and hemianopia.</p>

          <h3>Attention and Visual Processing Speed</h3>
          <p class="paragraph">One of my main research interests is understanding the mechanisms of attention and visual processing speed. I investigate how these cognitive processes influence our perception and decision-making abilities.</p>

          <h3>COVID-19 and Mental Health</h3>
          <p class="paragraph">The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on mental health worldwide. As part of my research, I explore the psychological effects of the pandemic and develop strategies to support mental well-being during these challenging times.</p>

          <h3>Visual Perception and Hemianopia</h3>
          <p class="paragraph">Another area of focus is visual perception and its role in various neurological conditions, such as hemianopia. I study how the brain processes visual information and how we can develop interventions to improve visual functioning for individuals with visual field deficits.</p>
